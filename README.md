# Made w/ Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

This repository contains code done for a Mock Google Calendar App. This project focuses more on the front-end framework and emphasizing more on how front-end is essential for making user's interaction to applications easier.

## Project Detail

Within this project, I wanted to review some aspects of React as well as incorporate some new elements such as TailwindCSS. I wanted to create a simple calendar application inspired by [this calendar application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUKyTRYGrnU). React has a lot of components that I was curious into relearning but I narrowed down what I wanted to do. Focusing on React's hooks, states, contexts, and async (intro level) functions.

## Challenges

I noticed in this codebase inside the video, there were a lot of functions in the components folder that could be optimized as a utility (util) function and so, focusing on reusability and readability, I centered these functions into more general molds that can be used in other components rather than specific cases where it would be constantly repeated.

## What did I learn

I learned that I still have a lot to learn and that front-end development is a fine skill to have. Specifically, being able to make an application that users can feel at ease by how simple the UI is. With this project, I am hoping that I can add some form of authentication such as Google's OAuth and implementing both NodeJS and a database to create a Full-Stack project.
